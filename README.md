Project Name:
Sentiment Analysis

Project Description:

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using spaCy, a popular natural language processing (NLP) library, to analyze the sentiment of product reviews. It loads a pre-trained English language model, preprocesses text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords and punctuation, and then classifies the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral based on the polarity score calculated by spaCy.

Importance:

Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding customer feedback and opinions about products or services. By automatically analyzing the sentiment of reviews, companies can gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance their products or services. This project provides a practical implementation of sentiment analysis that can be used by businesses to efficiently analyze large volumes of text data and derive actionable insights.

Functionality:

1. Loading Data: The project loads a dataset containing product reviews from a CSV file.
2. Preprocessing: It preprocesses the text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords and punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Using the spaCy model, the project analyzes the sentiment of each review and classifies it as positive, negative, or neutral.
4. Testing: The model is tested on sample reviews to demonstrate its functionality and accuracy.
